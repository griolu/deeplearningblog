# My To-Do List
## Brief
The fast.ai lesson recommends stopping in the middle of lesson 3 and adventuring into the world of deep learning. Their advice is why I am starting this blog. They have a top-down structure of learning, where they want us to learn the details when we need them rather than learning them all before doing any training and inferencing. So, before I continue lesson 3, there's some things I want to do. We've only learned image recognition so far, so most of these will be similar, but more practice lets me learn more.
## List
- Asian detector (inspired by Michael Reeves and for lesson 2 Questionnaire 23).
- Cat detector (because there's a neighbourhood cat that comes to my house every day). 
- Squirrel detector (because squirrels also like to come to my house). 

## Plan
I think each project will take me one to two weeks. So, I'll probably finish this list and move on to the more technical lessons by the end of the first week of March.
