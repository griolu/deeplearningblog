Introduction Hi, I’m Geon and this blog is where I’ll be posting my progress with deep learning. I’ve delayed continuing on with fast.ai until the new year (and new semester). As of January 25, 2021, I finished my second-last semester of high school and am starting my last semester on February 2, 2021. In the second semester, I’ll be more free and have more time to work on this blog. I’m free of English and I’ll have a pretty nice schedule: a spare period, Chemistry, Math, and Physics. What to expect I’m going to be uploading my progress of learning deep learning with fast.ai. So, I’ll be using fastpages and Google Colaboratory to make these posts. I’ll accompany the code with text to make it easy to understand. This section is broad because I’m not too sure yet of what I’ll be making. Expect to see a new blog post every week or two on Saturday or Sunday. Where to contact me (not that I check them often) Twitter: @griolu Instagram: @geon_youn</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My To-Do List</title><link href="https://griolu.github.io/deeplearningblog/markdown/2021/01/06/my-to-do-list.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My To-Do List" /><published>2021-01-06T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://griolu.github.io/deeplearningblog/markdown/2021/01/06/my-to-do-list</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html">My To-Do List Brief The fast.ai lesson recommends stopping in the middle of lesson 3 and adventuring into the world of deep learning. Their advice is why I am starting this blog. They have a top-down structure of learning, where they want us to learn the details when we need them rather than learning them all before doing any training and inferencing. So, before I continue lesson 3, there’s some things I want to do. We’ve only learned image recognition so far, so most of these will be similar, but more practice lets me learn more. List Asian detector (inspired by Michael Reeves and for lesson 2 Questionnaire 23). Cat detector (because there’s a neighbourhood cat that comes to my house every day). Squirrel detector (because squirrels also like to come to my house). Plan I think each project will take me one to two weeks. So, I’ll probably finish this list and move on to the more technical lessons by the end of the first week of March.</summary></entry></feed>
